# abyssibility

Forked from [Abyss](https://github.com/gerane/VSCodeThemes/blob/master/gerane.Theme-Abyss/themes/Abyss.tmTheme), mostly the same colors but with increased contrast.

## License
How do theme licenses work? I based this on the Abyss theme but I think I changed every color from what it was before so does it count as being a fork?

I'm honestly not 100% clear how the original theme was licensed. I think the version that VS Code includes by default is [this repository](https://github.com/gerane/VSCodeThemes/tree/master/gerane.Theme-Abyss) which doesn't seem to list a license at all, so I have no idea.

I've provided an MIT license, which at least applies to my changes, so have fun!
